The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in Guangzhou, China in 2003 were caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses with high homology. Since the 2019 novel coronavirus has strong transmissibility and progress rapidly. It has caused negative social effects and massive economic damage on a global scale. While there is currently no vaccine or effective drugs. Pulmonary fibrosis is a pulmonary disease with progressive fibrosis, which is the main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and quality of life decline in SARS survivors after recovery. Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients. Although there are no reports on the mechanism of COVID-19 inducing pulmonary fibrosis, based on the existing theoretical basis, we focus on the possible mechanism of COVID-19 sustained lung damaging, the key role of abnormal immune mechanism in the initiation and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis, and the corresponding therapeutic measures.
