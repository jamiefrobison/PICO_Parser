A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic cause by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens the world. We read with interest the recent report by Li et al. that included 610 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). They reported a high false-negative rate of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 detection. In addition, recent report regarding SARS-CoV-2 "turn positive" in recovered cases with COVID-19 were published. Here, we studied the characteristics of nucleic acid conversion for SARS-CoV-2 from 70 COVID-19 patients. We found that 15 (21.4%) patients experienced a "turn positive" of nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 after two consecutive negative results, which may be related to the false negative of RT-PCR test and prolonged nucleic acid conversion This article is protected by copyright.
