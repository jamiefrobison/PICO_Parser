Liver injury is common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplantation. We describe a case of COVID-19 in a patient who had transplantation three years previously for hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient came to clinic with symptoms of respiratory disease; pharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were positive. His disease progressed rapidly from mild to critical illness and was complicated by several nosocomial infections and multi-organ failure. Despite multiple invasive procedures and rescue therapies, he succumbed to the disease. The management of COVID-19 in the post-transplant setting presents complex challenges emphasizing the importance of strict prevention strategies.
