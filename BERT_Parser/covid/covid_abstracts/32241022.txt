BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is mainly spread through respiratory droplets or direct contact. But the infection condition of genital system is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is found in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 illness. METHODS: 10 women with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to in Tongji Zhongfa Hospital Intensive care union(ICU) ward from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 24, 2020 were included. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computer tomography(CT)-scan examination were retrospectively reviewed. The evidence of genital infection potential was accessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluids obtained from vaginal swab samples. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaginal fluids. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of these ten women were similar to those reported severe COVID-19 patients. All ten patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid, and all samples tested negative for the virus. CONCLUSION: Findings from this small group of cases suggest that no SARS-CoV-2 virus existing in the vaginal fluids of severe COVID-19 patients.
