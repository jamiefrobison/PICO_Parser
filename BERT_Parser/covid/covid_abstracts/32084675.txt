In December 2019, a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia began to occur. Its pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and general susceptibility. The current situation of prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia is severe. In this context, as front-line medical workers bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure. By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies(including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia. Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.
