An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among COVID-19 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system (ALS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. This article is protected by copyright.
