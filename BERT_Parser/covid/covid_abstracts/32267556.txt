We are living in unprecedented times. While we had near pandemic events in the recent past with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), we have never experienced anything like coronavirus (COVID-19), also known as SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the Spanish flu. In contrast to the Spanish flu where medical care was limited, we are equipped to combat COVID-19 but there is considerable work ahead with many uncertainties. At this critical time, we must come together as one united country and world to stop the spread and provide the best care possible for individuals who contract the virus and develop infection. A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.(1-3) However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.
