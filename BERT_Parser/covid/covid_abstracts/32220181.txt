We studied the epidemiological and clinical data collected from a family with 5 people, in which there were 3 family member diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that the first patient in this family had Wuhan city travel history. Close contact in daily life was the route of infection. The most common symptoms were fever, cough and weakness. Characteristic imaging changes were found with grass opacity (GGO), consolidation and septal thickening mainly distributed in peripheral and posterior area by thoracic CT scan in the 3 patients. The abnormality in laborotary test included lower white blood cell count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte countincreasing fibrinogen and C-reactive proteindecreasing myohaemoglobin and increasing lactate dehydrogenase. The epidemiological and clinical features could provide quicker diagnosis and better management for the COVID-19 infected patients.
