On December 31, 2019 a pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in the city of Wuhan (China). Due to the high capacity of diffusion and human infection it has become a new zoonotic pandemic. The absence of a vaccine has determined the search for antiviral drugs with the capacity to inhibit the replication of the new virus. Among them, remdesivir, an analogue of adenosine, is what seems to have a more promising future. This drug has shown in vitro and in animals a high capacity to block infection and viral replication with attainable concentrations in human plasma. Although all studies have been carried out with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems that by virological and functional analogy, remdesivir is one of the few antiviral drugs with proven efficacy. However, studies and clinical trials in humans are required to know the result of their application in them.
