OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate chest computed tomography (CT) findings in children with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia in our hospital. METHODS: This study included 22 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 from January to March 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: The most prevalent presenting symptoms were fever (64%) and cough (59%), and a mildly elevated mean (SD) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 11.22(11.06) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 18.8 (15.17) were detected. The major CT abnormalities observed were mixed ground-glass opacity and consolidation lesions (36%), consolidations (32%), and ground-glass opacities (14%). Peripheral distribution (45%) of lung lesions was predominant. Most of the lesions were multilobar (68%), with an average of three lung segments involved. CONCLUSION: Children with COVID-19 had relatively milder symptoms and less severe lung inflammation than adults. Chest CT plays an important role in the management of children with COVID-19 pneumonia.
