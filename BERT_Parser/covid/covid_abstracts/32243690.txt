In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide. Unlike SARS and MERS, where secondary transmission mostly occurred in hospital settings, COVID-19 transmission occurs in large numbers within families. Herein we report three cases of a familial cluster with one family member being a kidney transplant recipient. The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different. Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward. In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care. All three family members made a full recovery.
