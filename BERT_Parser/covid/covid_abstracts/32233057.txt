COVID-19 has caused "closure of all schools and universities throughout Italy cinemas, theaters and discoteques are shut down as well....(among) the few individuals who are out and about, I notice a lot of elbow bumping rather than both-cheek kissing and greater distance between people as they talk....the trains between Florence and Rome ...are largely empty." Lori Heatherington, Florence, Italy.
