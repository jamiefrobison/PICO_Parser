In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide. As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well-suited to apply their skillset to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including in vitro model systems, vaccine technology, and small molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines and tissue engineers are well-trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.
