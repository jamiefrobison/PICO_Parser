Since the first recognition of a cluster of novel respiratory viral infections in China in late December, 2019, intensivists in the United States have watched with growing concern as infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus-now named Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) -have spread to hospitals in the United States (US). Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight.COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and as anticipated has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources. Three of the hardest hit cities have been Seattle, New York City, and Chicago with a combined total of over 14,000 cases as of March 23, 2020.
