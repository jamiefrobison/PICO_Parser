OBJECTIVE: To analyze the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were included and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical staging based on Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6). The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types. RESULTS: Among 67 patients, 3 (4.5%) were mild cases, 35 (52.2%) were ordinary cases, 22 (32.8%) were severe cases, and 7 (10.4%) were critically ill. There were no abnormal CT findings in mild cases. In 35 ordinary cases, there were single lesions in 3 cases (8.6%) and multiple lesions in 33 cases (91.4%), while in severe case 1 case had single lesion (4.5%) and 21 had multiple lesions (95.5%). CT images of ordinary patients were mainly manifested as solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%). Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: CT images in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
