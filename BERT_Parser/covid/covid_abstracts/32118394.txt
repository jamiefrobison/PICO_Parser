With the increasing number of cases and widening geographical spread, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been classified as one of the class B infectious diseases but prevented and controlled as class A infectious disease by the National Health Commission of China. The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period.

This review will demonstrate how to applicate appropriate and individual management for lung cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19.
