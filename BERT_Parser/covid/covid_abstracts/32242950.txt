Since March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, with a series of confirmed cases that currently exceeded 300,000 people worldwide and with approximately 14,500 deaths. Accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 could have a dysregulation of the immune response that allows the development of viral hyperinflammation. Thus, all patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using laboratory parameters in order to improve mortality. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) are established inflammation markers that reflect systemic inflammatory response, and both are available in almost all laboratories. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether NLR and LCR values can help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.
