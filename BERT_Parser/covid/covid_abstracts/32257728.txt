Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic. Compared to adults, there has been a significantly smaller number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, although the incidence is increasing every day. This article looks to review specific epidemiological factors, symptomatology, laboratory and imaging workup, and other relevant metrics derived from the limited published literature that are specific to the pediatric population, to provide a review for the pediatric practitioner and guide, in part, the creation of a clinical algorithm for the management of COVID-19 in the pediatric population that can be utilized by pediatric institutions.
