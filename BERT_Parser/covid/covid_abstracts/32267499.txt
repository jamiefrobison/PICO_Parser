Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has emerged as a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular (CV) disease and plays a pivotal role in infections by coronaviruses and influenza viruses. The present review is primarily focused on the findings to indicate the role of ACE2 in the relationship of coronaviruses and influenza viruses to CV disease. It is postulated that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high, at least partly due to high ACE2 expression in populations with a high CV risk. Coronavirus and influenza virus vaccine usage in high CV risk populations could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronavirus/influenza virus infections.
