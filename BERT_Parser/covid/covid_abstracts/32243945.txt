As of March 24, 2020, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 379,661 infection cases with 16,428 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly. Herein, we presented four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received supportive care and convalescent plasma. Although all the four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy.
