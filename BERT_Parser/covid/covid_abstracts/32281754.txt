We are in the midst of a health emergency that is totally new for us all and that requires a concerted effort, especially when it comes to safeguarding patients on hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. Brescia is currently a very active cluster of infections (2918 cases on the 17/03/2020), second only to Bergamo. The way our structure is organised has allowed us to treat nephropathic patients directly within the Nephrology Unit, following of course a great deal of reshuffling; at the moment, we are treating 21 transplanted patients and 17 on hemodialysis. This has led us to adopt a systematic approach to handling this emergency, not only in managing inpatients, but also in researching the new disease. Our approach is mirrored in the guidelines attached to this article, originally intended for internal use only but potentially very useful to our colleagues, as they face the same exact problems. We have also started collecting data on our positive patients with the aim of understanding better the functioning of this disease and how best to manage it. If anyone is interested, we ask you to please get in touch with us, so we can coordinate our efforts.
