Some patients undergoing routine SPECT/CT and PET/CT examinations during the Covid-19 pandemic may incidentally reveal findings of Covid-19 associated pneumonia (C-19AP) on localizing CT. It is critical for Nuclear Medicine physicians to develop diagnostic skills for timely recognition of typical findings of C-19AP on a localizing CT. Furthermore, it is our responsibility to know the optimal practices for safely isolating and managing such patients while protecting the staff, other patients at the facility, family and/or friend accompanying the patients, and the public in general from risky exposure to Covid-19 sources. We offer several steps following an encounter suspicious of C-19AP.
