Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. Tens thousands of people have been infected with the disease. Our aim was to distinguish severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We retrospectively compared the data of COVID-19 patients with those of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (control patients). There were 78 COVID-19 patients and 26 control patients, whose median ages were significantly different (P=0.001). The percentage of COVID-19 patients admitting exposure to Wuhan was obviously higher than that of control patients (X(2) =29.130, P<0.001). Fever and cough appeared more frequently in COVID-19 patients than in the control patients. The routine blood work-up parameters of COVID-19 patients did not change much and their mean counts were in normal range. There were 38.5% of control patients had higher procalcitonin (PCT) levels than 0.5ng/ml, which was significantly higher than that percentage of COVID-19 patients (X(2) =22.636, P <0.05), and COVID-19 patients were also more likely to have decreased or normal urea and creatinine levels than control patients (X(2) =24.930, 8.480, P <0.05).Younger age, exposure to Wuhan, fever, cough, and slight changes in routine blood work-up parameters, urea and creatinine were important features discriminating COVID-19 from control patients. Slightly increased, but far less than 0.5ng/ml, PCT levels also differentiated COVID-19 patients from control patients This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
