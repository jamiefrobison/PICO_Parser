Early data from Wuhan, China show that patients with COVID-19 are typically male, aged 40 to 60 years, and about one-third have comorbidities. Moreover, of 138 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan and treated in an intensive care unit (ICU), 25% had cardiovascular disease and 58% hypertension; the respective figures for non-ICU-treated COVID-19 patients were 10% and 22% [1]. Based on these early data, a predisposition to acute cardiac complications related to underlying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may significantly increase the severity of COVID-19 in susceptible individuals.
