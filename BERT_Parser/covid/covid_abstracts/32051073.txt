Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. The epidemic has been spreading to other areas of the country and abroad. A few cases have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure. The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 2019-nCoV. A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far. In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent information at home and abroad.
