OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.
