The key healthcare challenge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the safe delivery of respiratory support on a large scale. The care of critically ill COVID-19 patients is guided by our knowledge and experience with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but this crisis is pushing patients and their clinicians into unchartered territories. One of the key decisions faced by healthcare systems is in selecting the appropriate devices for oxygen administration. The use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in COVID-19 is the subject of much debate, relating to the benefits and harms that may result for patients and healthcare workers alike.
