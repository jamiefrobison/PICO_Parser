We present clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features of 5 cases of pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus. Two patients had fever and dry cough, whereas the rest of 3 patients were asymptomatic. Three patients had unilateral ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the subpleural region on high-resolution chest CT, 1 patient had bilateral ground glass opacities, and 1 patient was negative for CT. We note that up to 66.7% asymptomatic patients had pulmonary lesions, so the asymptomatic children with Wuhan contact are recommended to do a 2019 novel coronavirus real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction screening. Unlike adult patients, only a small amount of patients had multilobes affected, so we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder CT findings than adults.
