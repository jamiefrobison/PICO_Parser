Objective: To summarize the clinical characteristics and liver biochemical parameters of 324 cases admitted with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Shanghai area. Methods: Clinical data and baseline liver biochemical parameters of 324 cases with novel coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 24, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the status of illness: mild type (mild and typical) and severe type (severe and critical).The differences in clinical data and baseline liver biochemical parameters of the two groups were described and compared. The t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for measurement data. The enumeration data were expressed by frequency and rate, and chi-square test was used. Results: Of the 324 cases with novel coronavirus pneumonia, 26 were severe cases (8%), with median onset of 5 days, 20 cases were HBsAg positive (6.2%), and 70 cases (21.6%) with fatty liver, diagnosed with X-ray computed tomography. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBil), albumin(ALB) and international normalized ratio (INR) of 324 cases at baseline were 27.86 +/- 20.02 U/L, 29.33 +/- 21.02 U/L, 59.93 +/- 18.96 U / L, 39.00 +/- 54.44 U/L, 9.46 +/- 4.58 mumol / L, 40.64 +/- 4.13 g / L and 1.02 +/- 0.10. Of which, ALT was > than the upper limit of normal (> ULN), accounting for 15.7% (51/324). ALT and AST > ULN, accounting for 10.5% (34/324). ALP > ULN, accounting for 1.2% (4/324). ALP and GGT > ULN, accounting for 0.9% (3/324). INR > ULN was lowest, accounting for 0.6% (2/324). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in ALT [(21.5 vs. 26) U / L, P = 0.093], ALP [(57 vs.59) U/L, P = 0.674], and GGT [(24 vs.28) U/L, P = 0.101] between the severe group and the mild group. There were statistically significant differences in AST (23 U/L vs. 34 U/L, P < 0.01), TBil (10.75 vs. 8.05 mumol / L, P < 0.01), ALB (35.79 +/- 4.75 vs. 41.07 +/- 3.80 g/L, P < 0.01), and INR (1.00 vs. 1.04, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The baseline liver biochemical parameters of 324 cases with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Shanghai area was comparatively lower and the liverinjury degree was mild, and the bile duct cell damage was rare.
