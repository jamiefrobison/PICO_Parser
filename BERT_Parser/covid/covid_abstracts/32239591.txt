BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised world concern for global epidemic since December, 2019. Limited data are available for liver function in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to investigate the risk factors related to liver injury in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in Non-ICU Ward at Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 23, 2020. Consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared. RESULTS: A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were included. 31.6%, 35.4% and 5.1% COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of ALT, AST and bilirubin, respectively. Median value of ALT, AST and bilirubin for entire cohort were 36.5 (17.5~71.5) U/L, 34.5 (25.3~ 55.3) U/L and 12.7 (8.1~15.4) mmol/L, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history, and symptoms between the two groups. Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with COVID-19 (p<0.05); Compared to patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, CRP and CT score (p< 0.05), and had a longer length of stay (p< 0.05). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the extent of pulmonary lesions on CT was a predictor of liver function damage (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury is common in Non-ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It may be related to systemic inflammation. Intense monitoring and evaluation of liver function in patients with severe pulmonary imaging lesions should be considered.
