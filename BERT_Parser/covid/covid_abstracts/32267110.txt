COVID-2019 disease mainly affects the respiratory tract and can progress in severe cases to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Patients with prior cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of developing an infection and progressing to a severe form of the disease. Also, due to the growing number of infected cases, it is clear that, in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms caused by the infection, some patients suffer from cardiovascular damage. This condition can, in fact, cause significant myocardial damage, which worsens the disease and affects the prognosis. Based on the results of currently published research, it seems important to discuss the manifestations and characteristics of myocardial damage induced by COVID-19 and its impact on patient prognosis.
