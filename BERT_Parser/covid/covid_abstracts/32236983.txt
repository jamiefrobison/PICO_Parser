The Covid-19 pandemic has already affected many thousands of people and has become the greatest health challenge worldwide [1]. The range of clinical presentations varies from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.

Herein, we share our personal opinions on the immunopathogenesis of this infection.
