BACKGROUND: Little is known about the perinatal aspects of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To summarize available evidence and provide perinatologists/neonatologists with tools for managing their patients. METHODS: Analysis of available literature on COVID-19 using Medline and Google scholar. RESULTS: From scant data: vertical transmission from maternal infection during the third trimester probably does not occur or likely it occurs very rarely. Consequences of COVID-19 infection among women during early pregnancy remain unknown. We cannot conclude if pregnancy is a risk factor for more severe disease in women with COVID-19. Little is known about disease severity in neonates, and from very few samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented in human milk. Links to websites of organizations with updated COVID-19 information are provided. Infographics summarize an approach to the pregnant woman or neonate with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the pandemic continues, more data will be available that could lead to changes in current knowledge and recommendations.
