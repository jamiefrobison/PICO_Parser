Respiratory RNA viruses are responsible for recurrent acute respiratory illnesses that still represent a major medical need. Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses. Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone- and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity. Compounds 6, 8, 16 and 17, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (25) and 5-hydrazone (22) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold. These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin. The molecular docking analysis explained the SAR of these compounds around their binding mode to the target RSV F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment. The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.
