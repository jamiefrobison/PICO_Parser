Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). There is very limited evidence base to formulate specific advice for dermatology patients on immunomodulators with regards to COVID-19. The following is based on expert opinion, taking into account known risks of influenza (a negative sense single-stranded RNA virus) and other, positive-sense single-stranded, RNA virus infections (such as SARS, MERS, and the common cold). An Australia/New Zealand consensus document is in development.
