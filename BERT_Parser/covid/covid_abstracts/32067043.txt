An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in China. It is unclear if the infectivity exists during the incubation period, although a person-to-person transmission has been reported in previous studies. We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of four patients in Shanghai, of which one was 88 years old man with moving difficulties and was only exposed to his asymptomatic family members who developed symptoms later. The epidemiological evidence has shown a potential transmission of the 2019-nCoV during the incubation period.
