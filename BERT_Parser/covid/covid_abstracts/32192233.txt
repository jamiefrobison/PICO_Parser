The novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2) initially discovered in Wuhan, China, has now become a global pandemic. We describe a patient presenting to an Emergency Department in Rhode Island on March 12, 2020 with cough and shortness of breath after a trip to Jamaica. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab for a respiratory pathogen panel as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. When the respiratory pathogen panel was positive for human metapneumovirus, the patient was treated and discharged. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR came back positive 24 hours later. Although respiratory viral co-infection is thought to be relatively uncommon in adults, this case reflects that SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms that exclude patients who test positive for routine viral pathogens may miss SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients.
