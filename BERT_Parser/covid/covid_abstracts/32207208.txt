Under specific circumstances, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women can be a target for respiratory infection, and lung examination may be required as part of their clinical evaluation, ideally avoiding exposure to radiation. We propose a practical approach for obstetricians/gynecologists to perform lung ultrasound, showing potential applications, semiology and practical aspects, which should be of particular importance in emergency situations, such as the current pandemic infection of COVID-19.
