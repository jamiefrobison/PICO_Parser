INTRODUCTION: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.
