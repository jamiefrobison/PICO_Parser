An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China and has now become a global public health concern. As of the early March, a total of 100,000 cases have been confirmed in multiple countries. Clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV that respiratory symptoms, such as cough, are the most common.[1] This is consistent with the finding that the majority of patients are virus-positive in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs suggesting it mainly invades and infects the respiratory system, a hypothesis supported by pathological data.[2] In addition, it has been reported that patients' stool has tested positive for 2019-nCoV, indicating that the virus could spread from the respiratory tract to the digestive tract, or that individuals could be infected via the faecal-oral route. However, the neuroinvasive potential of 2019-nCoV remains poorly understood.
