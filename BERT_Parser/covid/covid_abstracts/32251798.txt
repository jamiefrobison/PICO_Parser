OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of serological test and dynamitic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with suspected infection who were finally excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. RESULTS: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificity were 100% and 90.9%, respectively. In COVID-19 group, IgM positive rate almost increased first then decreased over time, however, IgG positive rate increased till 100% and was higher than IgM all the time. IgM positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after viral negative. IgG positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after viral negative. However, the median titer of IgG after viral negative was twice than that before with significant difference. CONCLUSION: Viral serological test is an effective diagnostic means for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The positive rate and titer variance of IgG are higher than that of IgM in COVID-19.
