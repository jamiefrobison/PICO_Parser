BACKGROUND: Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of Covid-19 infection. Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p<0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with Covid-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
