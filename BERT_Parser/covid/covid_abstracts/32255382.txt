RATIONALE: The current outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, spreads across national and international borders. The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in Chinese population was 4%. OBJECTIVES: To describe process of hospitalization and critical care of decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a multi-center observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, and 35 (32.1%) patients were female. 85 (78.0%) patients suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities. Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at early stage of disease. Overall, from onset of symptom to death, the mean time was 22.3 days. All 109 hospitalized patients needed ICU admission, however, only 51 (46.8%) had such a chance because of limited availability. The period of hospitalization to death in ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (SD, 8.8 days) and 12.5 days (8.6 days, P = 0.044), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in old people whose age was always above 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities. Patients admitted to ICU lived longer than those who did not gain admission to ICU. Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially ICU resource allocation.
