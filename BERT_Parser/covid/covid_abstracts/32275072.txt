The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection has become a challenging public health threat worldwide. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case of a convalescing pregnant woman diagnosed as COVID-19 infection 37 days before delivery in the third trimester. A live birth without SARS-CoV-2 infection was delivered successfully via the vagina. Findings from our case indicate that there is no intrauterine transmission in this woman who develops COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
