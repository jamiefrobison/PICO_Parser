As the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the world, and the associated lung disease COVID-19 remains difficult to treat, information from media and private communication flows at high speed, often through unfiltered channels. Much of this information is speculative, as it derives from preliminary and inconclusive studies, and creates confusion as well as anxiety. This phenomenon was recently labelled as "infodemic" by the World Health Organization.
