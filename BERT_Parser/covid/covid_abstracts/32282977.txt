Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing public health emergency of international concern. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 3-30% of patients with COVID-19 (1,2), because of direct virus-induced cytopathic effects in the respiratory tract or cytokine storms triggered by the host's immune response. Comorbidities are known to increase the risk of ARDS in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1).
