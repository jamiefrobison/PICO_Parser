Based on the higher mortality and the higher proportion of critically ill adults in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes, good inpatient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19. Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to specific circumstances of COVID-19 inpatients with diabetes. For mild patients, a strict glycemic control target (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.4-6.1 mmol/L, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG) 6.1-7.8 mmol/L) are recommended; a target for the glycemic control of common type patients (FPG 6.1-7.8 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L) and subcutaneous insulin deliver therapy are recommended; a target nonfasting blood glucose range of 10.0 mmol or less per liter for severe-type COVID-19 patients, a relatively Less stringent blood glucose control target (FPG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-13.9 mmol/L) for critically ill patients and intravenous insulin infusion therapy are recommended. Due to the rapid changes in the condition of some patients, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar status (HHS) maybe occur during the treatment. Blood glucose monitoring, dynamic evaluation and timely adjustment of strategies should be strengthened to ensure patient safety and promote early recovery of patients.
