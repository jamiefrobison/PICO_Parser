Since December 2019, a viral pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has swept the world. Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.
