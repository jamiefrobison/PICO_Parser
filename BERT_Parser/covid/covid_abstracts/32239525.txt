Orleans Parish in Louisiana is in the midst of an exponentially increasing number of patient admissions with COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms. Patients have been described having CT findings most consistent with an Early stage (< 7 days from symptoms onset) or an Advanced stage (8-14 days from symptoms onset). We describe and illustrate those Early and Advanced stage CT findings from patients with documented COVID-19 who have been admitted to University Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana.
