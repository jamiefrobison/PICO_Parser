The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still gradually spreading worldwide. The nucleic acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection, yet several recent studies have reported false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including laboratory examination results and computed tomography features. Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and other viruses has been discussed as well.
