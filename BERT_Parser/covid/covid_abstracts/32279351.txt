I read with great interest the systematic review by Ludvigsson on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). The author needs to be complimented for a well-timed, rigorous and rapid synthesis of the evidence from the rather scant data available on how the virus affects children. The review, which focused on all papers published up to 19 March, drew important conclusions that have significant practical implications for those involved in providing acute care for children suffering from this disease.
