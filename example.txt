11389303||METHODS : Sixty - eight children with ADHD , 6 to 12 years old , participated in a within - subject , double - blind comparison of placebo , immediate - release ( IR ) MPH 3 times a day ( tid ) , and Concerta , a once - daily MPH formulation . Three dosing levels of medication were used : 5 mg IR MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day ( qd ) ; 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd ; and 15 mg IR MPH tid / 54 mg Concerta qd . All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment , and each child 's dose level was based on that child 's MPH dosing before the study . The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to the daily doses of MPH that each child received . To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery determined by initial investigations to provide the necessary continuous coverage , Concerta doses were 20 % higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH . Children received each medication condition for 7 days . The investigation was conducted in the context of a background clinical behavioral intervention in both the natural environment and the laboratory setting . Parents received behavioral parent training and teachers were taught to establish a school - home daily report card ( DRC ) . A DRC is a list of individual target behaviors that represent a child 's most salient areas of impairment . Teachers set daily goals for each child 's impairment targets , and parents provided rewards at home for goal attainment . Each weekday , teachers completed the DRC , and it was used as a dependent measure of individualized medication response . Teachers and parents also completed weekly standardized ratings of behavior and treatment effectiveness . To evaluate the time course of medication effects , children spent 12 hours in a laboratory setting on Saturdays and medication effects were measured using procedures and methods adapted from our summer treatment program . Measures of classroom behavior and academic productivity / accuracy were taken in a laboratory classroom setting during which children completed independent math and reading worksheets . Measures of social behavior were taken in structured , small - group board game settings and unstructured recess settings . Measures included behavior frequency counts , academic problems completed and accuracy , independent observations , teacher and counselor ratings , and individualized behavioral target goals . Reports of adverse events , sleep quality , and appetite were collected . 
11398072||METHODS : This study was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in 62 subjects involving 12 once weekly nebulizations of 0.75 , 1.5 , or 3.0 mg of IL - 4R or placebo . During screening , subjects documented dependence on inhaled corticosteroids by an exacerbation in asthma induced by one or two 50 % dose reductions at 2 - week intervals . After restabilization for 2 weeks on the dose above which their asthma flared , inhaled steroids were discontinued , patients were randomized , and study medication was started on day 0 . 
11416112||METHODS : We studied 556 patients with lymph node - negative breast cancer . The median follow - up was 32 months . All patients with low tumor levels of uPA ( < or = 3 ng / mg of protein ) and of PAI - 1 ( < or = 14 ng / mg of protein ) were observed . Patients with high tumor levels of uPA (> 3 ng / mg of protein ) and / or of PAI - 1 (> 14 ng / mg of protein ) were randomly assigned to combination chemotherapy or subjected to observation only . All statistical tests were two - sided . 
11533366||DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : We conducted a double - blind , multicenter , multinational study at 93 centers worldwide : including 56 in the United States , and 21 in countries in Africa , Australia , Europe , North America , and South America . In this study , we randomly assigned 689 patients ( aged 2 - 5 years ) to 12 weeks of treatment with placebo ( 228 patients ) or 4 mg of montelukast as a chewable tablet ( 461 patients ) after a 2 - week placebo baseline period . Patients had a history of physician - diagnosed asthma requiring use of beta-agonist and a predefined level of daytime asthma symptoms . Caregivers answered questions twice daily on a validated , asthma-specific diary card and , at specified times during the study , completed a validated asthma-specific quality - of - life questionnaire . Physicians and caregivers completed a global evaluation of asthma control at the end of the study . Efficacy end points included : daytime and overnight asthma symptoms , daily use of beta-agonist , days without asthma , frequency of asthma attacks , number of patients discontinued because of asthma , need for rescue medication , physician and caregiver global evaluations of change , asthma-specific caregiver quality of life , and peripheral blood eosinophil counts . Although exploratory , the efficacy end points were predefined and their analyses were written in a data analysis plan before study unblinding . At screening and at study completion , a complete physical examination was performed . Routine laboratory tests were drawn at screening and weeks 6 and 12 , and submitted to a central laboratory for analysis . Adverse effects were collected from caregivers at each clinic visit . An intention - to - treat approach , including all patients with a baseline measurement and at least 1 postrandomization measurement , was performed for all efficacy end points . An analysis - of - variance model with terms for treatment , study center and stratum ( inhaled / nebulized corticosteroid use , cromolyn use , or none ) was used to estimate treatment group means and between - group differences and to construct 95 % confidence intervals . Treatment - by - age , - sex , - race , - radioallergosorbent test , - stratum , and - study center interactions were evaluated by including each term separately . Fisher 's exact test was used for between - group comparisons of the frequency of asthma attacks , discontinuations from the study because of worsening asthma , need for rescue medication , and the frequencies of adverse effects . Because of an imbalance in baseline values for eosinophil counts for the 2 treatment groups , an analysis of covariance was performed on the eosinophil change from baseline with the patient 's baseline as covariate .

12056703||PATIENTS AND METHODS : Twelve patients with chemorefractory SCLC participated in this pilot trial of paclitaxel combined with G3139 . G3139 was given by continuous i.v. infusion over 7 days at a fixed dose of 3 mg / kg / day . 
12057549||METHODS : Eligible women ( n=10141 ) had not given birth or were 24 h or less postpartum ; blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more , and proteinuria of 1 + ( 30 mg / dL ) or more ; and there was clinical uncertainty about magnesium sulphate . Women were randomised in 33 countries to either magnesium sulphate ( n=5071 ) or placebo ( n=5070 ) . Primary outcomes were eclampsia and , for women randomised before delivery , death of the baby . Follow up was until discharge from hospital after delivery . Analyses were by intention to treat . FINDINGS : Follow - up data were available for 10,110 ( 99.7 % ) women , 9992 ( 99 % ) of whom received the allocated treatment . 1201 of 4999 ( 24 % ) women given magnesium sulphate reported side - effects versus 228 of 4993 ( 5 % ) given placebo . Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 58 % lower risk of eclampsia ( 95 % CI 40 - 71 ) than those allocated placebo ( 40 , 0.8 % , vs 96 , 1.9 % ; 11 fewer women with eclampsia per 1000 women ) . Maternal mortality was also lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate ( relative risk 0.55 , 0.26 - 1.14 ) . For women randomised before delivery , there was no clear difference in the risk of the baby dying ( 576 , 12.7 % , vs 558 , 12.4 % ; relative risk 1.02 , 99 % CI 0.92-1.14 ) . The only notable difference in maternal or neonatal morbidity was for placental abruption ( relative risk 0.67 , 99 % CI 0.45-0.89 ) . INTERPRETATION : Magnesium sulphate halves the risk of eclampsia , and probably reduces the risk of maternal death .

Peak values were recorded for each parameter , and their distributions were compared . 
12578439||METHODS : Children with attention - deficit/ hyperactivity disorder were evaluated in a laboratory school to characterize onset and duration of the effect of a variety of methylphenidate regimens . In a proof - of - concept study , an experimental ascending profile was established by an initial bolus followed by small increasing doses of immediate - release methylphenidate in capsules administered every 30 minutes for 8 hours . Two proof - of - product studies of a new oral once - a - day formulation to deliver methylphenidate by an osmotic pump process based on OROS ( ALZA Corp , Mountain View , Calif ) technology ( hereafter referred to " OROS - methylphenidate " ) were conducted : a pharmacokinetic study and a pharmacodynamic study . 
12581572||PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients had stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) / IV non-small cell lung cancer , measurable disease , performance status 0 - 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group , adequate organ function , and no prior chemotherapy . Patients received dexamethasone premedication followed by paclitaxel at a dose of 90 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 8 , and 15 along with bryostatin - 1 50 microg/m ( 2 ) on days 2 , 9 , and 16 every 28 days until disease progression . Correlative assays measuring serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) , and T-lymphocyte numbers were performed based on a previous study showing cytokine induction in vivo by bryostatin - 1 . 
12610188||Patients were accrued primarily in the community setting . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with progressive , androgen - independent prostate cancer were randomly assigned to one of two treatments : either ketoconazole / doxorubicin alternating with vinblastine / estramustine ( KA / VE ) or paclitaxel , estramustine , and oral etoposide ( TEE ) . Patients were prospectively stratified on the basis of disease volume . The primary end points were response and overall survival time . 
12621132||We randomly assigned 635 patients with previous colorectal cancer to receive either 325 mg of aspirin per day or placebo . We determined the proportion of patients with adenomas , the number of recurrent adenomas , and the time to the development of adenoma between randomization and subsequent colonoscopic examinations . Relative risks were adjusted for age , sex , cancer stage , the number of colonoscopic examinations , and the time to a first colonoscopy .

Outcome included scores on McCoy 's sex scale questionnaire , the Psychological General Well - Being index and a self - esteem questionnaire , at baseline and after 24 weeks of either treatment . Serum concentrations of total testosterone , sex hormone binding globulin , free testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , androstenedione , estradiol , follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were analyzed at baseline and after 24 weeks of both treatment regimens . 
12627508||METHODS : This study , which was conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group , evaluated 42 patients who were asymptomatic and had manifested , progressive prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) elevation with hormone therapy . Continued use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was permitted ; however , patients were ineligible if they had received other treatments for their disease in the preceding 4 weeks or if they had received a long - acting antiandrogen therapy in the preceding 6 weeks . Patients were instructed to take 6 grams of green tea per day orally in 6 divided doses . Each dose contained 100 calories and 46 mg of caffeine . Patients were monitored monthly for response and toxicity . 
12631594||EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Three human epithelial cancer cell lines were investigated for preclinical study . Cells were analyzed for apoptosis and cell cycle characteristics after paclitaxel treatment . The Phase I / II clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer used pulsed low - dose paclitaxel three times / week with the starting dose of 15 mg / m ( 2 ) . Daily thoracic radiotherapy was delivered in 1.8 Gy / fraction to 60-65 Gy for gross disease and to 45 - 58 Gy for microscopic disease . Timing of radiotherapy was delayed to allow for a minimum of 4 h for cell cycle progression . 
12660125||To identify a possible benefit from antiseptic rinsing of the oral cavity , 47 patients were randomized to rinse either with a chlorhexidine - based product ( chlorhexidine concentration 0.3 % ; N=24 ) or with an amine-stannous fluoride combination ( control group ; N=23 ) . Patients were asked to rinse three times a day for 30s from the beginning of chemotherapy until the end of leukopenia . Before rinsing , as well as during and after leukopenia , aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity were counted . At the same time , the patients were assessed for mucositis . 
12663718||PATIENTS AND METHODS : Twenty patients who had not received prior therapy for metastatic disease were treated with 300 mg of R115777 orally every 12 hours for 21 of 28 days . Inhibition of FTase activity in peripheral - blood mononuclear cells was measured using a lamin B C - terminus peptide as substrate . Western blot analysis was performed to monitor farnesylation status of the chaperone protein HDJ - 2 . 
12684358||DESIGN AND SETTING : Randomized single - blind trial conducted from February 1999 to February 2002 at a university hospital in Italy . PATIENTS : One hundred twenty premenopausal obese women ( body mass index > or =30 ) aged 20 to 46 years without diabetes , hypertension , or hyperlipidemia . INTERVENTIONS : The 60 women randomly assigned to the intervention group received detailed advice about how to achieve a reduction of weight of 10 % or more through a low - energy Mediterranean - style diet and increased physical activity . The control group ( n = 60 ) was given general information about healthy food choices and exercise . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Lipid and glucose intake ; blood pressure ; homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity ; and circulating levels of interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) , interleukin 18 ( IL - 18 ) , C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , and adiponectin . 
12694666||METHODS : We evaluated ISIS 5132 at a dose of 4 mg / kg / day by continuous venous infusion , administered for 21 days q 4 weeks in 22 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in a standard two - stage Phase II design . Three patients were ineligible ; 19 patients are evaluable for toxicity and 16 for response . All patients had previously received systemic therapy for ovarian cancer ( 6 had one and 13 had two prior regimens ) . 
12699951||METHODS : Patients had diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic abdominal pain attributed to adhesions ; other causes for their pain had been excluded . If adhesions were confirmed during diagnostic laparoscopy , patients were randomly assigned either to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment . Treatment allocation was concealed from patients , and assessors were unaware of patients ' treatment and outcome . Pain was assessed for 1 year by visual analogue score ( VAS ) score ( scale 0-100 ) , pain change score , use of analgesics , and quality of life score . Analysis was by intention to treat . FINDINGS : Of 116 patients enrolled for diagnostic laparoscopy , 100 were randomly allocated either laparoscopic adhesiolysis ( 52 ) or no treatment ( 48 ) . Both groups reported substantial pain relief and a significantly improved quality of life , but there was no difference between the groups ( mean change from baseline of VAS score at 12 months : difference 3 points , p=0.53 ; 95 % CI - 7 to 13 ) . INTERPRETATION : Although laparoscopic adhesiolysis relieves chronic abdominal pain , it is not more beneficial than diagnostic laparoscopy alone . Therefore , laparoscopic adhesiolysis can not be recommended as a treatment for adhesions in patients with chronic abdominal pain . 
12721238||METHODS : In a two - site study , 155 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to receive androgen deprivation therapy for at least 3 months after recruitment were randomly assigned to an intervention group that participated in a resistance exercise program three times per week for 12 weeks ( 82 men ) or to a waiting list control group ( 73 men ) . The primary outcomes were fatigue and disease-specific quality of life as assessed by self - reported questionnaires after 12 weeks . Secondary outcomes were muscular fitness and body composition . 
12721240||PATIENTS AND METHODS : All 129 patients enrolled from 14 institutions between February 1998 and October 1999 were eligible . Patients received 4 g of glutamine or placebo orally , twice a day , beginning with the first or second day of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after RT . During treatment , patients were assessed weekly for toxicity , and a bowel function questionnaire was administered . The primary measures of treatment efficacy were diarrhea levels measured by maximum grade of diarrhea , incidence of diarrhea , and average diarrhea score . After completion of RT , the bowel function questionnaire was administered weekly for 4 weeks and at 12 and 24 months . Toxicity was measured by National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria . 
12743445||METHODS : After 4 - weeks ' run in , patients were randomized to 4 weeks ' once daily , double - blind treatment with either prucalopride 4 mg ( n = 27 ) or placebo ( n = 26 ) . A 50 % dose reduction after 2 weeks ' treatment was possible for patients with an excessive gastrointestinal response to the study medication ( severe cramps , abdominal pain , and diarrhea ) . Patients assessed efficacy using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and recorded bowel function in daily diaries . The investigator assessed efficacy and total gut transit time ( marker study ) . 
12749708||Between May 1999 and December 2001 , 18 patients with supratentorial glioblastoma were treated with boronophenylalanine ( BPA ) - based BNCT within a context of a prospective clinical trial ( protocol P - 01 ) .
